# 🚦 Traffic Signal Control using Reinforcement Learning (DQN)

An intelligent traffic management system built using **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)** to automatically control signal timing and reduce congestion.  
The agent learns **when to switch signals** by observing real-time vehicle queue lengths at a four-way intersection.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Traffic congestion at intersections is a major urban challenge.  
Traditional signal systems use fixed timers — they **don’t adapt** to dynamic vehicle flow.  

This project applies **Reinforcement Learning** to allow a traffic signal agent to:
- Learn the **optimal switching policy**
- Minimize **average waiting time**
- Improve **traffic flow efficiency**
